```
  SectionsStyles is a constant object that defines consistent margin-bottom (mb) spacing 
  for each section on the same page. This ensures uniform spacing between different sections 
  across various screen sizes (xs, sm, lg), maintaining a cohesive and organized layout.
```;

export const SectionsStyles = {
  mb: {
    xs: '12rem',
    sm: '14.4rem',
    lg: '16.8rem',
  },
};
